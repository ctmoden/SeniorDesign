# SeniorDesign
This is the repository for my video game development senior design/personal project. It is a simple shooter game developed with the Microsoft videogame framework
"Monogame". To access the binaries to play the game, click on the "Submission Release" in the "Release" section on the righthand side of the main repo page and download
"Submission.zip" file. Extract the zip file and click on the game executable "...\Submission\netcoreapp3.1\SeniorDesign" to play the game.
